Narwhal
=======

A flexible JavaScript standard library
--------------------------------------

Narwhal is a server-side JavaScript standard library conforming to the [ServerJS standard](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ServerJS). It is designed to work with multiple JavaScript interpreters, and to be easy to add support for new interpreters. Wherever possible, it is implemented in pure JavaScript to maximize reuse of code between platforms.


Packages
--------

A package consists of a directory of modules conforming to the ServerJS [Securable Modules](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ServerJS/Modules/SecurableModules) specification, and a "packages.json" file in the root of the package containing the location of the modules, dependencies, and other metadata.

A package directory might have the following files and directories:

* "package.json" for package metadata like dependencies and overrides for the conventional directory names.
* "local.json" for overrides on "package.json" provided by the user.
* "bin" for executables.
* "lib" for all object code, including JavaScript modules, and C extensions.
* "src" for all buildable source code, including C and Java source code.
* "jars" for Java class trees and archives.
* "packages/{name}" for installed sub-packages.
* "platforms/{platform}" for platform-specific packages.
* "parent" for an inherited package tree, like the "narwhal" package installed by the system administrator or OS package management system.

"package.json" and "local.json" may contain the following attributes:

* `name` - the name of the package.  The package system will only load one package with a given name.  The name defaults to the name of the parent directory.
* `lib` - a path or array of paths to top-level module directories provided in this package.  Defaults to ["lib"].
* `jars` - for Rhino platforms, a path or array of paths to directories to add to the Java CLASSPATH (uses a Java URLClassLoader, so accepts ".jar" paths and directory paths ending with "/").
* `packages` - a path or array of paths to directories containing additional packages, defaults to ["packages"].
* `platforms` - a path or array of paths to directories containing platform-specific packages, defaults to ["platforms"].  These platform packages will be loaded if and in the prioritized order they appear in the `system.platforms` array, and with higher priority that those in this package's generic "js" path so that they can override platform-specific modules.
* `main` - a path to a main program if the package is run with "bin/narwhal" and its directory instead of a specific script.
* `author` - may be a comment on the package's author and email in angle brackets.
* `contributors` - may be an array of additional author names and email addresses in angle brackets.
* `parent` - a path to a package tree to inherit, like the "narwhal" package installed by the system administrator.  Defaults to "parent" if a symlink exists by that name.


Platforms
---------

To add Narwhal to a new platform, you need two main things:

1. A "thunk" which sets up a fixtures object with a few required objects, then loads "narwhal.js" (usually consists of a shell script at "bin/PLATFORM" and short JavaScript file at "narwhal-PLATFORM.js")

2. Platform implementations for core modules, such as File (located in "platforms/PLATFORM")


Available Packages
------------------

* Jack: the web server and web application/framework agnostic interface, similar to Ruby's Rack and Python's WSGI. Narwhal was conceived while building Jack, and was later extracted into it's own project.

* Nitro: a web application framework built on top of Jack.
