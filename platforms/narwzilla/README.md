Narwhal Platform: Prototype implementation
===========================================================

In the extensions folder, you can find a prototype extension that can be installed on any XULRunner-based application.  A current prototype extension will need to be installed on Firefox (alternatively, you can just copy narwhal.js from extension folder to firefox's components folder;
after restaring firefox, you should be able to run narwhal with the narwzilla platform).

<pre>
<code>
tusk platform narwzilla
narhwal
</code>

NOTE: Currently narwhal runner uses firefox's "Development" profile. To create one, you can run firefox with the command line argument -P.
