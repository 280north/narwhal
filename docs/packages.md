Available Packages
==================

You can download and install packages using the `tusk` application that comes with Narwhal.  Check out `tusk help` for details.  These are some of the packages:

* `jack`: the webserver and web application/framework agnostic interface, similar to Ruby's Rack and Python's WSGI. Narwhal was conceived while building Jack, and was later extracted into it's own project.
